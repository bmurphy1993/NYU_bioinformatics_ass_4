1. Open Assn_4_Group_7_Final.ipynb in Google colab or jupyter notebooks.
2. Replace any instances of the placeholder, "<<INSERT PERSONAL GOOGLE DRIVE DIRECTORY>>" with the Google Drive directory where you would like to output the results of the GSEA Prerank analysis.
3. Run all steps of the notebook.
4. The first code block will mount your Google Drive. Follow the steps given when this block runs.
  
The heatmap, clustermap, and NES bar plots will show up in the notebook, and the GSEA outputs will appear in a folder called "GSEA_Prerank" in the Google Drive folder you specified in step 2.
